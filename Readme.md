## Project Description
The **Adaptive Curriculum dApp for Students** is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts. This system aims to provide an adaptive learning environment for students by allowing them to enroll in courses, track their progress, and receive certificates upon course completion. With this application, students can manage their own learning journey while ensuring transparency and immutability of their academic records.

The platform is designed for educational institutions and students to interact in a decentralized manner. The curriculum can adapt to the needs of individual students based on their progress, and courses can be added dynamically by administrators.

## Project Vision

The **Adaptive Curriculum dApp** aims to create a decentralized, transparent, and customizable learning ecosystem. The vision is to empower students to take control of their education by providing a secure and verifiable record of course enrollment and completion. This vision also extends to educational institutions, enabling them to manage curriculums and student progress more efficiently and transparently.

## Key Features

- **Course Management**: Administrators can create and add new courses to the system, with details such as the course name, description, and duration.
- **Student Enrollment**: Students can enroll in courses. Their enrollment is recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent record of their educational journey.
- **Course Completion Tracking**: Students can mark courses as completed. The system tracks the completion of each course and updates the student’s record accordingly.
- **Immutable Record**: Once a course is completed, it’s recorded on the blockchain, ensuring that academic achievements are verifiable and tamper-proof.
- **Personalized Curriculum**: Students can have a personalized curriculum based on their enrollment and progress in the system. They can see which courses they’ve completed and which courses remain.
- **Decentralized**: The contract is deployed on the blockchain, eliminating the need for centralized control and making the process more efficient and secure.

### Future Improvements
1. **Adaptive Learning Paths**: Implement a system where the courses offered can be dynamically adjusted based on the student's progress or performance.
2. **Certification System**: Issue digital certificates (using tokens or badges) upon course completion.
3. **Token Economy**: Introduce tokens to incentivize students to complete courses or unlock special content.
4. **Performance Tracking**: Include more detailed progress metrics, such as grades or scores, for each course.
